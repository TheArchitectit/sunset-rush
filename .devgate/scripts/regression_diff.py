"""regression_diff.py — hunk-accurate diff parsing + failure-registry matching.

Helper module for scripts/regression_check.py, split out to keep both files
under DevGate's own 500-line hard limit. Language-agnostic: nothing here assumes
a language, package manager, or directory layout.

What lives here:

  * parse_diff / get_added_lines — extract ADDED lines from a unified diff as
    (path, new_line_number, text). Hunk-accurate, so findings report the REAL
    line number rather than an offset into a concatenated blob.
  * compile_registry_patterns / check_added_against_registry — compile each
    failure-registry entry's `regression_pattern` and match it against added
    lines, honouring the entry's optional `file_glob` scoping. DevGate has
    always STORED regression_pattern; this is what reads it.
  * load_failure_registry / load_active_failures — registry loading split by
    status: patterns are enforced for active AND resolved entries (a resolved
    bug is exactly the one that must not come back), while the affected-files
    advisory stays active-only.

Only ADDED lines are ever scanned, so pre-existing legitimate code is never
flagged — only new introductions.
