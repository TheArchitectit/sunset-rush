"""Fixture-based tests for the regression gate's diff + registry matching.

Satisfies the prevention_rule recorded in FAIL-2026071301: "add a unit test
asserting rules fire on a known violation". A gate that silently stops firing is
worse than no gate, so these tests assert the gate FIRES on known violations and
stays SILENT on the cases that must not trip it.

Runnable two ways (DevGate's run-tests.mjs discovers test_*.py via pytest, and
this file also works standalone with plain asserts):

    python3 tests/test_regression_check.py     # standalone
    pytest tests/test_regression_check.py      # via run-tests.mjs

Covers:
  * line-number accuracy on a synthetic multi-hunk, multi-file diff
  * regression_pattern fires when a known bug's signature is re-added
  * file_glob scoping (pattern only fires for matching files)
  * SELF_REFERENTIAL exclusion (definition files never self-match)
  * --all tag-base behaviour (tag wins; HEAD~20 only when no tag exists)
  * --all fails loud when the base diff errors (no vacuous green)
  * guardrails-allow annotations silence the entry they name, and only it
  * touched-vs-untouched hard file-size classification
